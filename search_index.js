The LETKF is a variant of the Ensemble Kalman Filter that combines a prior probability distribution of state variables (e.g., river discharge) with direct or indirect observations (in this case, water surface elevation and width) to generate an optimal estimate (i.e., analysis). The prior distribution is represented by the model error covariance, which is calculated empirically from an ensemble of unknown model states (i.e., background ensemble). The observations and their uncertainty are represented by mapping the state variables to the observations space (e.g., river discharge to water surface elevation) and an error covariance. The analysis state (both the mean and the ensemble deviations from the mean) is essentially calculated as a function of the prior model ensemble, the model and observation error covariances, and the difference between the model-predicted observations and the actual observations.","category":"page"},{"location":"algorithm/","page":"Algorithm","title":"Algorithm","text":"The estimation of river discharge from future SWOT observations can be difficult when bed elevation and/or roughness are unknown due to equifinality. One approach that can aid in the solution of such problems is regularization, wherein additional constraints are introduced in the form of penalty terms similar to the observation difference applied to the LETKF analysis calculation. In the case of river discharge estimation, additional constraints can be derived from the at-a-station hydraulic geometry relations. In particular, it can be shown that assimilating “observations” of the form W  aQ b=0, is equivalent to a form of regularization that is adding prior knowledge (in our case adherence to the AHG equations) to help solve an ill-posed inverse problem.","category":"page"},{"location":"algorithm/#Priors","page":"Algorithm","title":"Priors","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"algorithm/","page":"Algorithm","title":"Algorithm","text":"Ensemble assimilation methods require the definition of a prior probability distribution from which to generate the ensemble of background variables.

Because river discharge will not be directly observed from SWOT, a number of algorithms of varying complexity have been developed to estimate discharge from SWOT observables. The SAD algorithm operates on the set of SWOT observables (i.e., WSE, width, and slope) and derives an estimate of river discharge and its associated uncertainty using a data assimilation scheme. The assimilation scheme involves the “first‐guess” estimation of hydraulic variables by combining a forward model with a set of prior probability distributions before assimilating the SWOT observations. The priors are estimated with a sampling approach, as these data‐driven methods have shown promise in many fields. The objective of the algorithm is to estimate discharge at each river reach when SWOT observations become available.","category":"page"}]
